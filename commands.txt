MySQL is a popular relational database management system. Here are some commonly used MySQL commands:

1. Connect to a MySQL server:
   
   mysql -u <username> -p
   

   Replace `<username>` with your MySQL username. You will be prompted to enter your MySQL password after executing this command.

2. Create a new database:
   
   CREATE DATABASE database_name;
   

   Replace `database_name` with the name you want to give to your database.

3. Select a database to work with:
   
   USE database_name;
   

   Replace `database_name` with the name of the database you want to select.

4. Create a table:
   
   CREATE TABLE table_name (
     column1 datatype,
     column2 datatype,
     ...
   );
   

   Replace `table_name` with the name you want to give to your table. Specify the column names and their respective data types.

5. Insert data into a table:
   
   INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
   VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
   
   Replace `table_name` with the name of the table. Specify the column names and the corresponding values you want to insert.

6. Retrieve data from a table:
   
   SELECT column1, column2, ...
   FROM table_name
   WHERE condition;
   

   Replace `table_name` with the name of the table. Specify the column names you want to retrieve. You can use the `WHERE` clause to add conditions to filter the data.

7. Update data in a table:
   
   UPDATE table_name
   SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
   WHERE condition;
   

   Replace `table_name` with the name of the table. Specify the column names and their new values. Use the `WHERE` clause to specify the condition for updating specific rows.

8. Delete data from a table:
   
   DELETE FROM table_name
   WHERE condition;
   

   Replace `table_name` with the name of the table. Use the `WHERE` clause to specify the condition for deleting specific rows.

9. Drop a table:
   
   DROP TABLE table_name;
   

   Replace `table_name` with the name of the table you want to drop. This permanently deletes the table and its data.

10. Exit the MySQL command-line:
    
    EXIT;
    

    Use this command to exit the MySQL command-line interface.

These are just a few examples of commonly used MySQL commands. MySQL provides many more commands and features for database management and querying.
